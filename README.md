Problem Statement 
There definitely have been several problems with transitioning to a fully online study model in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. After the pandemic essentially hit in early 2020 our whole academics shifted from offline to online mode. This basically was the reason that there for all intents and purposes was no interaction between the students of our batch and societies of the institute. BPIT+ specifically is a social media website which tackles these issues by providing our college students a platform to interact and participate in college activities effortlessly, which for the most part is quite significant for them to gain exposure and experience. They will be up to date with events taking place in the college, participating in which, will help them enhance their skills and make them more confident to face the outer world. This platform will help the students to connect with their peers, share ideas and work on new technologies, etc. This will also help them to stay in touch with their seniors or juniors and ask for their advice or give them advice and be up to date with what new technologies or projects they are currently working on and the internships that they have done.

Proposed Solution
BPIT+ is based on FULL STACK WEB DEVELOPMENT. The project is developed using ReactJS, NodeJS, ExpressJS, Context API, and MongoDB. On opening the project link, the user will be prompted to the landing page with the details of the project and a signup/login button. The signup/login functionality is powered by MongoDB and JWT password encryption. After registering/signing in, the user can also sign out and will be redirected to the landing page. The home page of this web application will have several posts that would be made by college societies to spread the word about their society and promote their events on this platform so that it could reach a wider audience. The project will retrieve the data from the MongoDB server. The User-Interface of this project is made using ReactJS and styling is done using CSS. The backend of this project is developed using NodeJS, ExperessJS. MongoDB is used as the Database. Version Control System (Git) will be used while making this project to store the various versions of this project.
